## About

I work at the intersection of **design, product and technology**, with a background spanning over 15 years in design leadership and product-oriented work, combined with hands-on experience in modern web development.

My professional focus is on creating **clear, usable and well-considered digital experiences**, where design decisions are grounded in user needs, business context and technical feasibility. I am comfortable moving between strategic discussions and practical execution, and I collaborate closely with developers to ensure that ideas translate into sustainable solutions.

I do not position myself as a specialist developer, but as a **product- and design-driven digital professional with strong technical understanding**, capable of contributing meaningfully across disciplines.
